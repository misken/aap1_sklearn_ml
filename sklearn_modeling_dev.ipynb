    "# Module 1 - Statistical/ML modeling\n",
    "In the Intro to Data Science and/or Practical Computing for Data Analytics course, you learned how to create predictive models using techniques such as regression and tree-based methods. We will build on that knowledge and build classification models in Scikit-learn (sklearn) using a few different techniques, including logistic regression models with regularization - a technique for helping with variable selection and dimensionality reduction. learn about combining techniques into what are known as ensemble models. In addition, we’ll look at creating tree-based models within sklearn (both bagged and boosted). \n",
    "\n",
    "META: Picking up where we left off in pcda class. Leverages recently learned topics and much of this material is already developed and just needs cleaning and updating. For example, the regularization stuff is in R. We can weave the regularization in as part of the bundle of techniques used in the ensemble models. Let’s do classification. Gives gentle introduction to basic OO concepts but we aren’t really writing new OO code. Good place to introduce project structure, version control, and basic analysis pipelines. \n",
